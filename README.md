## Instructions

1. **Combine Flours:**
   - In a large mixing bowl, combine the buckwheat flour and all-purpose flour.

2. **Make a Well:**
   - Create a well in the center of the flour mixture.

3. **Add Water:**
   - Gradually add water to the well, stirring with your fingers or a fork.

4. **Knead the Dough:**
   - Once the dough starts to come together, knead it on a lightly floured surface.
   - Add more water if needed to form a smooth, elastic dough.

5. **Rest the Dough:**
   - Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and let it rest for at least 30 minutes to allow the gluten to relax.

6. **Roll Out the Dough:**
   - Roll out the dough on a floured surface until it's about 2-3 mm thick.

7. **Cut into Noodles:**
   - Dust the rolled-out dough with extra buckwheat flour to prevent sticking.
   - Cut the dough into thin strips to form soba noodles.

8. **Cook the Noodles:**
   - Boil a large pot of water and cook the soba noodles for 3-4 minutes or until they are al dente.
   - Stir occasionally to prevent sticking.

9. **Rinse and Drain:**
   - Drain the noodles and rinse them under cold water to remove excess starch.
    
10. **Hot Soba or Cold Soba:**
    - Follow the instructions for either Hot Soba or Cold Soba (see previous responses) using your freshly made soba noodles.
